## 🧠 What I Learned
* Android platform fundamentals (Activities, lifecycle, UI)
* Sensors & device hardware (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer)
* Location services & Google Maps integration
* Background components (Services, AsyncTask for background work)
* Local persistence with SQLite (custom SQLiteOpenHelper)
* Networking: making HTTP POST requests, JSON payloads (including integration with cloud endpoints)
* Cloud integration (AWS S3 / API endpoints in class assignments)
